## Remove Max Width
Most pages within Canvas are shown with a lot of white-space on the right-hand side when viewed on a wide-screen monitor. 
For my 1920x1080 monitor, the width gets limited to 1366px, so there is about 29% of the screen that's wasted.
This user script overrides the max-width restriction Canvas puts on pages within a course.
